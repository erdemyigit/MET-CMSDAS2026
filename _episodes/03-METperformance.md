## MET performance

A well-measured Z boson or photon provides a unique event axis and a precise momentum scale for evaluating MET performance.
To achieve this, the response and resolution of MET are studied in samples where a Z boson decays to a pair of electrons or muons, or in events with an isolated photon.
**Such events should have little to no genuine MET.**

The MET performance is then assessed by comparing the momentum of the vector boson to that of the hadronic recoil system.
The hadronic recoil system is defined as the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all PF candidates, excluding the vector boson (or its decay products in the case of Z boson decay).

Momentum conservation in the transverse plane imposes

$$\vec{q}_{T} + \vec{u}_{T} + \vec{p}_{T}^{miss} =0$$,

where $\vec{q}_{T}$ is the transverse momentum of the Z boson, and $\vec{u}_{T}$ is the hadronic recoil.

Define two components of the hadronic recoil to study the MET response and resolution:
- hadronic recoil parallel ($u_{||}$) to the boson axis: sensitive to the scale of boson/jets
- perpendicular ($u_{\perp}$) to the boson axis: sensitive to isotropic effects like pileup

Specifically, the mean of the distribution of the magnitude of $q_{T} + u_{||}$, is used to estimate the MET response, whereas the RMS of $q_{T} + u_{||}$ and $u_{\perp}$ distributions are used to estimate the MET resolution in the axis parallel and perpendicular to the Z boson, respectively. 

An example of the $q_{T} + u_{||}$ and $u_{\perp}$ distributions is shown in the following plots.

Use the distribution of the parallel and perpendicular components of the hadronic recoil to measure the MET scale and resolution
- Get the mean of the parallel component to estimate MET scale.
- The RMS of the distributions gives the MET resolution in each direction.
